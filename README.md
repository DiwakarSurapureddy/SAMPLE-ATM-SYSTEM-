# SAMPLE-ATM-SYSTEM-
🏦 ATM Banking System using Python (OOP & Abstract Classes)
This project is a console-based ATM Banking System developed using Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and Abstract Base Classes (ABC). It simulates real-world ATM operations such as balance checking, deposits, withdrawals, PIN verification, and transaction history management.


🚀 Features:
🔐 Secure PIN verification with limited attempts
💰 Check account balance
➕ Deposit money
➖ Withdraw money with maximum withdrawal limit
📜 Transaction history tracking
🔢 Counts total number of transactions
🏦 Uses Abstract Class for enforcing transaction structure


🧠 Concepts Used
Abstract Classes & Methods (abc module)
Inheritance & Method Overriding
Encapsulation (private & protected members)
Class methods
Exception-safe logical flow
Real-world ATM simulation using Python

🛠 Technologies
Python 3
OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

📂 Project Structure
BankAccount (Abstract Class) – Defines mandatory transaction method
Account (Base Class) – Handles account details and security
A_T_M (Child Class) – Implements ATM functionalities

▶️ How to Run
Clone the repository
Run the Python file
Enter account details and PIN
Use the ATM menu to perform transactions


📌 Use Case
This project is ideal for:
Python beginners learning OOP
Understanding Abstract Classes in real applications
Academic mini-projects
Interview preparation
